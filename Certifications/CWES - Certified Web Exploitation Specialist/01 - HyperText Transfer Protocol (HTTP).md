 [HTTP](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616) is an application-level protocol used to access the World Wide Web resources. The term `hypertext` stands for text containing links to other resources and text that the readers can easily interpret.

HTTP communication consists of a client and a server, where the client requests the server for a resource. The server processes the requests and returns the requested resource. The default port for HTTP communication is port `80`, though this can be changed to any other port, depending on the web server configuration. The same requests are utilized when we use the internet to visit different websites. We enter a `Fully Qualified Domain Name` (`FQDN`) as a `Uniform Resource Locator` (`URL`) to reach the desired website, like [www.hackthebox.com](http://www.hackthebox.com/).

# URL

![[Pasted image 20250727201527.png]]

|**Component**|**Example**|**Description**|
|---|---|---|
|`Scheme`|`http://` `https://`|This is used to identify the protocol being accessed by the client, and ends with a colon and a double slash (`://`)|
|`User Info`|`admin:password@`|This is an optional component that contains the credentials (separated by a colon `:`) used to authenticate to the host, and is separated from the host with an at sign (`@`)|
|`Host`|`inlanefreight.com`|The host signifies the resource location. This can be a hostname or an IP address|
|`Port`|`:80`|The `Port` is separated from the `Host` by a colon (`:`). If no port is specified, `http` schemes default to port `80` and `https` default to port `443`|
|`Path`|`/dashboard.php`|This points to the resource being accessed, which can be a file or a folder. If there is no path specified, the server returns the default index (e.g. `index.html`).|
|`Query String`|`?login=true`|The query string starts with a question mark (`?`), and consists of a parameter (e.g. `login`) and a value (e.g. `true`). Multiple parameters can be separated by an ampersand (`&`).|
|`Fragments`|`#status`|Fragments are processed by the browsers on the client-side to locate sections within the primary resource (e.g. a header or section on the page).|

The main mandatory fields are the scheme and the host, without which the request would have no resource to request.

# HTTP Flow

![[Pasted image 20250727202104.png]]

The diagram above presents the anatomy of an HTTP request at a very high level. The first time a user enters the URL (`inlanefreight.com`) into the browser, it sends a request to a DNS (Domain Name System) server to resolve the domain and get its IP. The DNS server looks up the IP address for `inlanefreight.com` and returns it. All domain names need to be resolved this way, as a server can't communicate without an IP address.

**Note:** Our browsers usually first look up records in the local '`/etc/hosts`' file, and if the requested domain does not exist within it, then they would contact other DNS servers. We can use the '`/etc/hosts`' to manually add records to for DNS resolution, by adding the IP followed by the domain name.

Once the browser gets the IP address linked to the requested domain, it sends a GET request to the default HTTP port (e.g. `80`), asking for the root `/` path. Then, the web server receives the request and processes it. By default, servers are configured to return an index file when a request for `/` is received.

In this case, the contents of `index.html` are read and returned by the web server as an HTTP response. The response also contains the status code (e.g. `200 OK`), which indicates that the request was successfully processed. The web browser then renders the `index.html` contents and presents it to the user.

## cURL

[cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/) (client URL) is a command-line tool and library that primarily supports HTTP along with many other protocols. This makes it a good candidate for scripts as well as automation, making it essential for sending various types of web requests from the command line, which is necessary for many types of web penetration tests.

We may also use cURL to download a page or a file and output the content into a file using the `-O` flag. If we want to specify the output file name, we can use the `-o` flag and specify the name. Otherwise, we can use `-O` and cURL will use the remote file name, as follows:

We can silent the status with the `-s` fla.
```shell-session
Usage: curl [options...] <url>
 -d, --data <data>   HTTP POST data
 -h, --help <category> Get help for commands
 -i, --include       Include protocol response headers in the output
 -o, --output <file> Write to file instead of stdout
 -O, --remote-name   Write output to a file named as the remote file
 -s, --silent        Silent mode
 -u, --user <user:password> Server user and password
 -A, --user-agent <name> Send User-Agent <name> to server
 -v, --verbose       Make the operation more talkative
```
